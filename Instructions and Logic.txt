To run this simulation:

1. Run it from the command line: php game_of_life.php
1.1 Press Ctrl+C to stop the simulation

Key features of this implementation:
25x50 grid size (appears square in terminal due to character spacing)
Random initial state
Uses '' for live cells and '.' for dead cells
Updates every 100ms (adjustable via usleep())

Follows Conway's Game of Life rules:
Any live cell with < 2 neighbors dies (underpopulation)
Any live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
Any live cell with > 3 neighbors dies (overpopulation)
Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
